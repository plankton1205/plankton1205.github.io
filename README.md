This is the repository that holds the source code for my personal website. It's built using the awesome [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), and powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). Big thanks to them! And also to this marvellous GitHub open source community (plus quite some help from AI) that allows me — just a chill guy without any coding experience — to setup such a personal website that I fully control, so easily and affordably!
